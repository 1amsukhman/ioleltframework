## home or news feed

The news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as EdgeRank), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.[1][2]

A new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into iolet, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' iolet activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011, Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.

Initially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as "Facebook-Stalking". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.

With the introduction of the "New Home feed" in early February came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.

## friends & Following
See also: Friending and following
"Friending" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a "friend request" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the "Not Now" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The "Not Now" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.

It is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as "unfriending" by Facebook.[3] Many Facebook users also refer to the process as "de-friending".[4] "Unfriend" was New Oxford American Dictionary's word of the year in 2009.[5][6] Facebook does not notify a user if they have been unfriended, but there are scripts that provide this functionality.[7] There has also been a study on why Facebook users unfriend, which found that differences, especially between ages, and few mutual friendships were the dominant factors correlated with unfriending, all of which mirrors the decline of physical-world relationships.[8]

Facebook profiles also have advanced privacy features to restrict content to certain users, such as non-friends or persons on a specific list.

At one point, Facebook had introduced the "Friend Wheel" to visualize the connections a user's friends had with other friends. This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API.

##wall
The Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see their full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.

In July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.[9] In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics.

The concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter,[10] began September 14, 2009. This meant putting the name of a user, a brand, an event or a group[11] in a post in such a way that it linked to the wall of the Facebook page being tagged, and made the post appear in news feeds for that page, as well as those of selected friends.[12] This was first done using the "@" symbol followed by the person's name. Later, a numerical ID for the person could be used. Visually, this was displayed with bold text.[13] Early in 2011, tagging in comments was added.

In addition to postings by other users, the Wall also displayed other events that happened to the user's profile. This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.

The Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011.

## Timeline
In September 2011, it introduced "Timeline" at its developer conference, intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. "Cover" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts.[14][15][16] Timeline began gradually rolling out to users in New Zealand starting December 7, 2011,[17] and was made officially available to all users worldwide on December 15.[18][19] By January, the switch to Timeline became required for all users.[20][21] In February 2012, Timeline became available for Facebook Pages.[22]

### likes and reactions
The like button, enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos, links shared by friends, videos and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content appears in the News Feeds of that user's friends,[24][25] and the button also displays the number of other users who have liked the content, including a full or partial list of those users.[26] The like button was extended to comments in June 2010.[27] After extensive testing[28] and years of questions from the public about whether it had an intention to incorporate a "Dislike" button,[29] Facebook officially rolled out "Reactions" to users worldwide on February 24, 2016, letting users long-press on the like button for an option to use one of six pre-defined emotions, including “Like”, "Love", "Haha", "Wow", "Sad", or "Angry" and for a limited time the following reactions, “Care”, “Pride Flag”, “Thankful”.[28][30] Reactions were also extended to comments in May 2017.[31][32]

## Comments
To mark the 30th anniversary of the GIF, it has introduced a new feature enabling users to add GIFs to comments. The eagerly-awaited feature can be accessed using the GIF button located beside the emoji picker. Users can choose from the available GIFs sourced from Facebook's GIF partners, but cannot upload other GIFs.

GIFs aside, the comments feature also allow users to attach stickers. It has a standard sticker set, whereby sticker options are categorised according to popular moods and activities such as "Happy", "Eating", and "Confused". In 2020, Facebook introduced "Make Your Avatar"[33] which enables users to customize a virtual look-alike of yourself to use as stickers in comments as well as Messenger chats. Essentially Facebook’s version of Snap’s Bitmoji, Avatars have been since made available in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Canada.

## Notifications
Notifications tell the user that something has been added to his or her profile page. Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.

## Groups

Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.

Groups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have two different levels of privacy settings:

"Open" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.
"Secret" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.[60]
Previously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.[61] Version 1 or "new" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an "open" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.[62]
